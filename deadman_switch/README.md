# Deadman Switch â€“ SSH Login Monitor & Email Notifier

`deadman_switch` is a Python utility that monitors a Linux system's SSH login activity and sends email alerts if a specific user has not logged in within a configured time threshold. It uses log parsing and configurable thresholds to determine whether a "warning" or "critical" email should be triggered.

---

## Use Case

Ideal for environments where regular logins are expected from a specific account, and their absence may indicate an issue - such as compromised access, automation failure, or system outage.

---

## Features

- Parses `/var/log/auth.log` for the last `Accepted publickey for <user>` entry
- Determines alert level based on elapsed time since last login
- Sends warning or critical emails via Yahoo SMTP
- Maintains state (last login, previous alerts) in a JSON file
- Supports configurable threshold values
- Designed to run from cron or systemd timer

- Python 3.6+
