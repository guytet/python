# Python Utilities

This repository is a collection of self-contained Python utilities built for personal use. While originally developed to solve specific needs in system web apps, home automation, system administration, or experimentation, code published publicly in case others find them useful.

Each script is intended to be understandable, practical, and focused on a narrow task.

## Purpose

- Provide ready-to-use Python code for everyday tasks
- Serve as a personal codebase for repeatable patterns
- Share simple utilities that may be relevant to others

## Structure

Code are organized by directory or filename based on their function. Most are standalone and require minimal setup.
